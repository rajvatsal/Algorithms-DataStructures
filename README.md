# Algorithms & Data Structures

To build simply run `make` on the root directory

In this repository I try to implement common CS algorithms/data structures in C to get better

## ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED

- Quicksort(middle)
- Bisection Method

## ALGORITHMS TO BE IMPLEMENTED

 **Sorting**

- Mergesort
- Radix sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubblesort
- Quicksort (mean of median, randomized)
- Perfect sort -> an algorihtm that uses above algorithms to get the best result based on the dataset size

**Data Structures**

- Linked List (circular and linear)
- Tree
- Graph

**Search**

- Binary Search
- BFS
- DFS

**Algorithms**
- Minmax
- Shuffling
- Knight Travails (TOP)

**Nsa**

- Some other methods
